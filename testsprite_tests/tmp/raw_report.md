## 1️⃣ Document Metadata
- **Project Name:** portfolio
- **Date:** 2025-12-10
- **Prepared by:** TestSprite AI Team

## 2️⃣ Requirement Validation Summary

#### Test TC001
- **Test Name:** Verify portfolio renders correctly across multiple screen sizes
- **Test Code:** [TC001_Verify_portfolio_renders_correctly_across_multiple_screen_sizes.py](./TC001_Verify_portfolio_renders_correctly_across_multiple_screen_sizes.py)
- **Test Error:** The portfolio layout and all sections (Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Contact) render properly and are visually distinct on desktop devices with no layout breaking or content overlap. Due to environment constraints, tablet and mobile responsive checks could not be performed. Therefore, the task is partially completed with desktop verification successful but tablet and mobile responsiveness unverified.

However, due to the current environment limitations, I was unable to execute the 'npm install' and 'npm build' commands to fully validate the build and deployment process including type checks, linting, bundling, and artifact generation. Therefore, the task is only partially completed. To fully complete the task, access to a terminal or build environment is required to run these commands and verify the output artifacts.

#### Test TC007
- **Test Name:** Verify presence and correctness of server reference manifest and metadata
- **Test Code:** [TC007_Verify_presence_and_correctness_of_server_reference_manifest_and_metadata.py](./TC007_Verify_presence_and_correctness_of_server_reference_manifest_and_metadata.py)
- **Test Error:** The server-reference-manifest.json file is not accessible via the web interface or API endpoints, both returning 404 errors. To verify the presence of encryption key metadata and correct references, please provide access to the server file system or upload the .next/server/server-reference-manifest.json file so I can inspect its contents directly.

[WARNING] [Fast Refresh] performing full reload

Fast Refresh will perform a full reload when you edit a file that's imported by modules outside of the React rendering tree.
You might have a file which exports a React component but also exports a value that is imported by a non-React component file.
Consider migrating the non-React component export to a separate file and importing it into both files.

It is also possible the parent component of the component you edited is a class component, which disables Fast Refresh.
Fast Refresh requires at least one parent function component in your React tree. (at webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./node_modules/next/dist/client/components/react-dev-overlay/app/hot-reloader-client.js:112:24)

[WARNING] [Fast Refresh] performing full reload

Fast Refresh will perform a full reload when you edit a file that's imported by modules outside of the React rendering tree.
You might have a file which exports a React component but also exports a value that is imported by a non-React component file.
Consider migrating the non-React component export to a separate file and importing it into both files.

It is also possible the parent component of the component you edited is a class component, which disables Fast Refresh.
Fast Refresh requires at least one parent function component in your React tree. (at webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./node_modules/next/dist/client/components/react-dev-overlay/app/hot-reloader-client.js:112:24)

#### Test TC009
- **Test Name:** Test error handling by simulating GSAP ScrollTrigger load failure
- **Test Code:** [TC009_Test_error_handling_by_simulating_GSAP_ScrollTrigger_load_failure.py](./TC009_Test_error_handling_by_simulating_GSAP_ScrollTrigger_load_failure.py)
- **Test Error:** The task to simulate GSAP ScrollTrigger failure and verify app behavior was not fully completed because the failure simulation step was not performed. However, the app was tested under normal conditions with ScrollTrigger loaded: it did not crash or freeze during navigation, scrolling, or form submission. No error logs related to ScrollTrigger failure were found. To fully complete the task, a method to block or override the GSAP ScrollTrigger script load is needed to simulate failure and verify graceful error handling and logging. Current testing confirms app stability under normal conditions but does not confirm behavior under ScrollTrigger failure.
